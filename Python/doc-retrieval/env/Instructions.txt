3. Open a terminal/cmd and move to the same directory where you placed ieri_env.yml

4. Create the environment with the following command:
	conda env create -f irei_env.yml

5. Activate environment with the following command:

Notes:
	- The environment uses python 2.7, so python 3.x syntax won't be supported.
