The required anaconda environment (all the needed dependencies to run the retrieval system) can be checked in the env/irei_env.yml and instructions on how to set it up are provided.

To run the system just call python main.py and an interactive prompt should appear (it will let you choose the type of retrieval system and run several queries in the same execution).
Note this code has been developed for python 3 nd compatibility with older versions has not been tested.

Also, in the data/folder, datafiles can be replaced (if the same format is kept).
